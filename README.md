"My temporary storage"
(Edit December 3 2019: Apparently I thought dumping unfinished Unity Projects on GitHub was a good idea. Shame that I never even pushed the files am I right?

So I think this was an idea I had at the back of my mind for a game where you design "robots" which are spawned from opposing bases and fight against each other. Think of it like an RTS for programers. Still think it's an idea with potential if I ever **do** actually work on it. )
